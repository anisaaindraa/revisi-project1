              A programming language is a system of notation for writing
              computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based
              formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind
              of computer language. The description of a programming language is
              usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
              semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal
              language.

                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
                language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading
                Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
                local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
                pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                and originally included cues for its appearance.

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
                SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is
                designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
                including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
                improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
                relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
                and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
                file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of
                formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
                same markup page in different styles for different rendering
                methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
                browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
                CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
                accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from
                the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This
                cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications
                are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet
                media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS
                by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation
                service for CSS documents.[5] In addition to HTML, other markup
                languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML,
                SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.
